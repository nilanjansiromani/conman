![CONMAN](https://github.com/nilulin/conman/blob/master/intro/logo.png?raw=true)

## Conman is web-developer's utilty
Quite often we want to test out how our UI would look like on the live site.
The usual setup involves a complicated setup of mock-servers, reverse proxy and possibly MITM (man in the middle proxies).

But what if all that was not even needed.
What if I could programmatically control and mock error scenarios, and test out any UI with confidence.

ConMan helps you do just that !

Its not just limited to mocking apis.
You can mock literally anything resource that is requested by the browser.
- html
- scripts
- css
- images
